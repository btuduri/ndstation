1) Link widgets to methods in NDStation-patching that way the GUI can be independent of the
patching methods.

2) Clean up the widget layout, maybe make NDStationWindow a child of Window so that I can 
eliminate the repeated typing of lengthy widget names.

3) Figure out treelist views for batch patching.
