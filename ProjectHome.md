## About ##
NDStation is a flasher for the EZFlash 3-in-1 Expansion Pack distributed by EZTeam. It uses a PC application to generate .nds files which contain Gameboy Advance ROM images.

These .nds files can then be run on a Nintendo DS Slot 1 flash cart, such as the R4DS, to achieve maximum integration of the EZFlash 3-in-1 Expansion Pack with the Slot 1 cartridge.

Currently, client applications for both Microsoft Windows and Linux are under development.
